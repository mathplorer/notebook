Discrete math studies structures that come in separate pieces: objects in a set, choices in a counting problem, and outcomes in a probability experiment.

This mini-lesson moves through three connected questions:

- What belongs to a collection?
- How many outcomes are possible?
- How likely is a particular event?`,

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects. If $A = \\{2,4,6\\}$, then $4 \\in A$ means 4 is a member of $A$, while $5 \\notin A$ means 5 is not a member.

Common operations:

- $A \\cup B$ keeps everything in either set.
- $A \\cap B$ keeps only what the sets share.
- $A \\setminus B$ keeps what is in $A$ but not in $B$.
- A complement keeps everything outside the event or set, relative to the universal set.

Venn diagrams are a picture of this logic: left-only, overlap, and right-only regions tell you where each element belongs.`,

Combinatorics is the math of counting without listing every possibility.

The **multiplication principle** says that if one choice can happen in $a$ ways and the next can happen in $b$ ways, then the pair can happen in $a \\cdot b$ ways.

Factorials count full arrangements: $n! = n \\cdot (n-1) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 1$.

Permutations count arrangements where order matters. Combinations count choices where order does not matter.`,

A **sample space** is the set of every possible outcome. An **event** is a subset of the sample space.

For equally likely outcomes:

$$
P(\\text{event}) = \\frac{\\text{favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total outcomes}}
$$

The complement rule says $P(\\text{not } A) = 1 - P(A)$. For independent events, one event happening does not change the probability of the other, so simple combined probabilities multiply.`,
